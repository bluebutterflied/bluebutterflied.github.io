## Research Statement

I am a highly motivated and dedicated student currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences (FAST) in Pakistan. My educational journey has provided me with a solid foundation in a wide range of computer science and engineering disciplines, enabling me to explore and excel in various areas of technology and innovation. With a passion for continuous learning and a drive to make meaningful contributions to the field, I am committed to conducting research that pushes the boundaries of what is possible in the realm of technology.

My academic coursework has equipped me with a strong understanding of core computer science concepts, including programming languages such as C, C++, Cuda, Python, and Java, as well as expertise in web development, web scraping, and DevOps practices. I have also delved into the exciting field of artificial intelligence, gaining experience in machine learning, artificial neural networks, genetic algorithms, natural language processing, computer vision, and data analysis. This background, coupled with my knowledge of cybersecurity and networking, has instilled in me a desire to explore cutting-edge technologies and solve complex problems.

One of my research interests lies in the area of cloud computing, particularly in deploying and managing applications using cloud services such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. I have hands-on experience in setting up cloud infrastructure, including EC2 instances, RDS databases, S3 buckets, and using DevOps tools like Git, Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and Terraform. I am eager to explore further how cloud computing can revolutionize the way we develop, deploy, and scale applications.

Moreover, I am deeply interested in natural language processing (NLP) and its applications, especially in the context of healthcare. Currently, I am working on a research project focused on the digitization of prescriptions using NLP techniques, which has the potential to improve patient care and streamline medical record-keeping.

As I progress in my academic journey, I aim to collaborate with experienced researchers and faculty members to further develop my skills, explore new research areas, and contribute to the scientific community. My extensive experience in software development, system administration, and problem-solving, as well as the practical knowledge I have gained through internships and hands-on projects, will be valuable assets as I embark on my research endeavors.

In summary, my academic background, hands-on experience, and passion for innovation make me a dedicated and eager researcher who is poised to tackle the complex challenges in the ever-evolving world of technology. I am excited to take on new research projects and look forward to contributing to the advancement of computer science and technology.



## Student Statement

My journey as a student at the National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences (FAST) has been a remarkable and transformative experience. I have not only acquired a diverse set of skills but also cultivated a deep passion for technology, innovation, and lifelong learning. This journey has allowed me to explore a myriad of subjects and engage in various extracurricular activities that have contributed to my personal and professional growth.

At FAST, I have dedicated myself to my studies, majoring in Computer Science. Through rigorous coursework and hands-on projects, I have gained proficiency in multiple programming languages, web development, web scraping, DevOps practices, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity. My ability to adapt to new technologies and methodologies has been honed through practical experience and a steadfast commitment to excellence.

Beyond academics, I have actively participated in numerous student organizations. As the Lead Graphic Designer at IEEE FAST NUCES Peshawar, I led a talented team in creating visually engaging designs for university-level competitions. I also served as a Presentations Planner at COLAB Research Lab, where I organized and coordinated presentations for the benefit of fellow students.

My role as the Lead Event Organizer at the Microsoft Student Learn Ambassador Society was a significant responsibility. I led the Debate Competition section of a core event, promoting intellectual discourse and critical thinking among students. In addition, as a General Video Graphics Creator at ACM Campus Society, I contributed to the creation of introduction videos for major events and handled post-video production for various competitions at FAST Peshawar campus.

One of my most fulfilling experiences has been my involvement in Project X Roleplay Pakistan, where I have served as a Lead Moderator and Event Organizer. This role allowed me to manage a variety of virtual events within Pakistan's largest roleplay community.

Membership in professional organizations has been an important part of my journey. I have been a member of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and the Microsoft Student Learn Ambassador (MLSA) Student Chapter. These associations have broadened my horizons and exposed me to the latest trends and developments in the tech industry.

In addition to my academic and extracurricular activities, I have been actively engaged in a wide range of projects. These projects span web development, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and software development. Notable achievements include deploying static and dynamic websites on AWS, implementing microservices architecture, and developing applications using Kubernetes and Jenkins.

I have also delved into artificial intelligence, working on projects involving machine learning, artificial neural networks, genetic algorithms, and natural language processing. The project on digitizing prescriptions using NLP techniques is particularly exciting, as it has the potential to revolutionize healthcare.

My internships with CODSOFT, Automation Play Network, and Pakistan Aeronautical Complex have been invaluable experiences, enabling me to apply my skills in real-world scenarios and gain insights into various aspects of the tech industry.

My academic journey has not only been about accomplishments but also about building relationships with professors who have recognized my dedication and awarded me with recommendation letters. These letters serve as a testament to my commitment to academic excellence.

As I continue my studies, I am eager to explore new areas of computer science, engage in cutting-edge research, and contribute to technological advancements. My journey as a student has been marked by a deep passion for technology, a dedication to learning, and a commitment to making a positive impact in the world of computer science and beyond.
