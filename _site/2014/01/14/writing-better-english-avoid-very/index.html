          <p>I return with a minor post after another long break. This time, it’s about writing better English. Now, this isn’t humblebragging but I cannot be considered excellent at English writing – at least not by native standards. English is not my first language and I haven’t had much formal English education. I have, however, read a lot. Even if my English is not good, I can still point out some tips shared by experts.</p>

<p>Here’s the first one of those shared by Amanda Patterson on Writers Write. It’s a list of <a href="http://writerswrite.co.za/45-ways-to-avoid-using-the-word-very">45 words you can use to put emphasis</a> on words without using the word “very”. I found it refreshingly helpful.</p>

<p>Bear in mind though that you cannot just go ahead and use a word without looking up its usage examples. Some words might have negative connotations even though the dictionary meanings look positive. For example, if you use the word ‘<a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/adequate">adequate</a>’ to describe someone’s work, they might be offended even though the dictionary meaning is that of acceptable quality.</p>

<p>p.s. After writing this, I searched for the word “very” and found two instances where I had used the word myself. I replaced it with better alternatives.</p>
