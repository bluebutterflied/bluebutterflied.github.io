<h2 id="adobe-photoshop-cc">Adobe Photoshop CC</h2>

<p>Photoshop cc is the most reliable and latest version of photoshop. I myself using this version nowadays. The interface of it is much user friendly and easy to use.</p>

<h2 id="intro-to-the-interface">Intro to the interface</h2>

<p>This is the main interface of Photoshop.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/clt/adobe-photoshop/2.png" alt="2" /></p>

<p>It consists of the following portions,</p>

<ul>
  <li>Document Window</li>
  <li>Toolbar</li>
  <li>Options Bar</li>
  <li>Menu Bar</li>
  <li>Pannels</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="document-window">Document Window</h2>

<p>This is called the Document Window. You can see 1 document opened in it with the name <strong>Untitled-1</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/clt/adobe-photoshop/3.png" alt="3" /></p>

<p>Here all the documents are present on which you can work and switch from one document to the other.</p>

<h2 id="toolbar">Toolbar</h2>

<p>The toolbar is the small window present on the top left of the interface. Here, all the basic tools are present that are being used widely in a work. Adobe is also introducing new tools to it from time to time. Have a look on the toolbar window.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/clt/adobe-photoshop/4.png" alt="4" /></p>

<p>Here it is. This is the toolbar. All the tools of Photoshop are present here.</p>

<h2 id="option-bar">Option Bar</h2>

<p>Options bar is the place where the following options are present:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Adjusting size</li>
  <li>Font adjustment</li>
  <li>Color Changing</li>
  <li>Perspective Options</li>
  <li>Shadow</li>
  <li>Opacity</li>
  <li>Fade</li>
  <li>e.t.c</li>
</ul>

<p>It is present on the topmost of the interface. The picture attached below shows the option bar.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/clt/adobe-photoshop/5.png" alt="5" /></p>

<p>Here the uppermost bar is the options bar.</p>

<h2 id="menu-bar">Menu Bar</h2>

<p>Just like the options bar menu bar is also a small bar present on the topmost of the interface Photoshop window. It consists of options like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Importing a picture</li>
  <li>Exporting a picture</li>
  <li>Changing Size</li>
  <li>Making Document</li>
  <li>Blur Menu</li>
  <li>Flare Menu</li>
  <li>Camera Raw Filter</li>
  <li>e.t.c</li>
</ul>

<p>Have a look at this window,</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/clt/adobe-photoshop/6.png" alt="6" /></p>

<h2 id="pannels">Pannels</h2>

<p>Pannel is the place where your work happens. Photoshop basically works on the basis of layers. These layers are present in the panels. In addition to it, we can add effects to the documents using panels. Panels can also be used to keep the record of every single step that you do on a document. Here is a preview of the Panel,</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/clt/adobe-photoshop/7.png" alt="7" /></p>

<p>So this was all the basic infrastructure of Adobe Photoshop. I will discuss these menus further in the next blogs.</p>
