Most tests I’ve seen are more about understanding of English than about intelligence. This one (although I still don’t see how a test can measure intelligence) is far better. Take the “Ultimate IQ Test” and see if you score higher than me. I got a 139 last time I took it. Do tell me if you even attempt the “Test for Exceptional Intelligence”. That one’s sure to give you a headache." />
