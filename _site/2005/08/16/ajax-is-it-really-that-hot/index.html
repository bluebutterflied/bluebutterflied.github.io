          <p>I’ve been reading a lot about this AJAX (Asynchronous Javascript and XML). Just recently I discovered the process by which it works and I was astonished to see that it took people so long to actually realize this possibility. I’d put forward this proposal quite a long time back (Althoug I must admit - not that seriously) of loading only partial content in a webpage much like in frames.</p>

<p>(For those of you who have no clue what AJAX is, here’s a link: <a href="http://www.pixel2life.com/twodded/t_ajax_asynchronous_javascript_and_xml_using_php_to_send_data_/">AJAX tutorial</a>. Google’s Gmail and A9.com are taking this quite far)</p>

<p>Anyway, the purpose of this post is to point out another way to do the same thing.</p>

<p>Here’s the thing: The purpose of AJAX is to load partial content into an HTML page (basically inside a div’s innerhtml). This is done through Javascript’s XMLHttpRequest object. The browser loads the xml that is requested by the javascript and then the javascript loads it into a div’s innerhtml (or whereever, for that matter).</p>

<p>Now, here’s another option for doing this whole thing that takes at least a few lines of javascript code:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;a href=”codepage.php?var=value” target=”divName”&gt; Click here to load VAR&lt;/a&gt;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, I know that this can be a little difficult when the variable’s value has to be decided by javascript but even then, why not just set a property ‘location’ of a div to the desired URL instead of going through the XML routine. This would:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Enable easier creation mechanism (even for novice web designers who aren’t good with Javascript).</li>
  <li>Let the browsers do what they’re good at! Fetching and displaying data.</li>
  <li>Not just XML but any form of data, specially binary data can also be retreived on-the-fly.</li>
</ol>

<p>To explain 3:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;a href=”nextCar.png” target=”imageID”&gt; Next Car &lt;/a&gt;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The same dynamics work for any HTML tag.</p>

<p>Another option can be to set not just the default property but ANY property of ANY HTML element.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;a href=”divStyle.php” target=”DivID.Style”&gt;Change<br />
Style&lt;/a&gt;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’d love to see comments on this post. Tell me if I’m mistaken. Tell others if I’m right.</p>
