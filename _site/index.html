		</div>
		<div class="post"><p>I wrote a tutorial on <a title="Install, Configure and Execute Apache Hadoop from Source" href="http://www.csrdu.org/nauman/2010/09/25/install-configure-execute-apache-hadoop-from-source/" target="_blank">getting started with Hadoop</a> back in the day (around mid 2010). Turns out that the distro has moved on quite a bit with the latest versions. The tutorial is unlikely to work. I tried setting up Hadoop on a single-node "cluster" using Michael Knoll's <a href="http://www.michael-noll.com/tutorials/running-hadoop-on-ubuntu-linux-single-node-cluster/" target="_blank">excellent tutorial</a> but that too was out of date. And of course, the official documentation on Hadoop's site is lame.</p>
<p>Having struggled for two days, I finally got the steps smoothed out and this is an effort to document it for future use.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>I'm going to try to break this up in a couple of posts so that it's easier to read. This first part is going to be discussing the setup of a workable environment and then building Hadoop from the source. The reason for building from source is that if you have a 64-bit OS, the Hadoop tarball will not include 'native libraries' for your system and you will get weird errors such as this one:</p>
<p><code>WARN util.NativeCodeLoader: Unable to load native-hadoop library for your platform... using builtin-java classes where applicable<br />
</code></p>
<p>It's just a warning but it messes up with some startup scripts enough to make things unstable. So, we build from the source. First, though, let's setup an environment that we can re-use if we mess things up. If you really don't want a VM and instead want to go with a physical machine, just go ahead and install <strong>Ubuntu 12.04.3 LTS Server</strong> on a physical machine and skip the next section. Just name the main user '<em>hadoop</em>' and keep the password as '<em>hadoop</em>' as well so that you can follow along the rest of the tutorial with ease.</p>
<h2>Environment Setup</h2>
<p>My main machine is a Ubuntu 13.10 64-bit system but that is not important because we are going to set up a Virtual Box machine. That has the major advantage of easy backup if we mess things up.</p>
<p>So, download virtualbox in any way you want. For Ubuntu, that would be simply:</p>
<p><code>sudo aptitude install virtualbox -y<br />
</code></p>
<p>Afterwards, it's best to add a separate host-only adapter to virtualbox and add a network interface to your machine.</p>
<ol>
<li>For the first step, start virtualbox, click on 'File -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Network' and simply click on the 'Add Host-Only Network' button.</li>
<li>Then, create a 64-bit Ubuntu machine (I kept the default settings of 8GB hard drive and 1GB RAM). Once that is done, right-click on the machine (I named my ub64_1) and in the network settings, add another interface with Host-Only Network setting. That way, you will have internet access through NAT and host-connectivity through this second interface.</li>
</ol>
<p>Alright, with that done, we can start the virtual machine, attach an ISO file to the new machine and install <strong>Ubuntu 12.04.3 64-bit Server</strong>. Defaults work fine -- just set the main user's username as '<em>hadoop</em>' with '<em>hadoop</em>' as the password. Reboot the machine and make sure you can ping the host machine and the network.</p>
<p>I had a problem with the machine when it started -- eth1 was missing and thus host-guest connectivity was gone. If that is the case, edit <code>/etc/networking/interfaces</code> and add eth1 below eth0 with auto settings. That and a reboot should fix the connectivity. Btw, you can start the VM in headless mode to save some resource using <code>VBoxHeadless -startvm hdub_64_1<br />
</code> </p>
<h2>Downloading and Building Hadoop</h2>
<p>Alright, now that we have a clean working machine, let's get the build essentials for Hadoop first. For that, you need to use the following command:</p>
<p>[sourcecode lang="bash"]<br />
sudo apt-get install -y&amp;nbsp;<br />
gcc g++ make maven cmake zlib zlib1g-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev<br />
[/sourcecode]</p>
<p>You will notice that Hadoop's official documentation mentions protoc but we aren't installing that. The reason is that the protoc version in Ubuntu's repos is older than what is needed. So, we will be building protoc from source as well.</p>
<p>To build protobuf, we download the source and bulid it from source. The following commands should work fine:</p>
<p>[sourcecode lang="bash"]<br />
curl -# -O https://protobuf.googlecode.com/files/protobuf-2.5.0.tar.gz<br />
gunzip protobuf-2.5.0.tar.gz<br />
tar -xvf protobuf-2.5.0.tar<br />
cd protobuf-2.5.0<br />
./configure --prefix=/usr<br />
make<br />
make install<br />
protoc --version<br />
[/sourcecode]</p>
<p>The last command should tell you that you have protoc version 2.5.0 installed. Of couse, we also need the Java bindings of protobuf for Hadoop to use. For that, do the following: </p>
<p>[sourcecode lang="bash"]<br />
cd java<br />
mvn install<br />
mvn package<br />
[/sourcecode]</p>
<p>That's it for protobuf. Now, to finally get building Hadoop itself. Download the source for 2.2.0 (current stable version) from the <a href="http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/hadoop/common/" target="_blank">Hadoop releases page</a>. Pick a mirror and download the latest source. I downloaded this one for example, <a href="http://www.eu.apache.org/dist/hadoop/common/stable/hadoop-2.2.0-src.tar.gz" target="_blank">http://www.eu.apache.org/dist/hadoop/common/stable/hadoop-2.2.0-src.tar.gz</a>.  </p>
<p>[sourcecode lang="bash"]<br />
wget http://www.eu.apache.org/dist/hadoop/common/stable/hadoop-2.2.0-src.tar.gz<br />
tar zxf hadoop-2.2.0-src.tar.gz<br />
[/sourcecode]</p>
<p>Now, there is a problem with the source. One of the maven pom files is incorrect. To fix that, apply the following patch: </p>
<p>[sourcecode lang="diff"]<br />

The whole religion versus science becomes very pronounced in the creation-or-evolution debate. I read through a lot of material and was able to understand natural selection quite easily. It’s not all that complicated as some would like to suggest. It’s simply this: whoever is the better in a particular situation survives. It’s easy to understand once you realize that that’s a tautology. Whoever survives is the “fittest” and the fittest survives. So, no problems there but there was always something that didn’t quite fit. I could never quite digest the “theory” that micro-evolution (birds changing bone shape etc.) could lead to macro evolution (going from single-strand RNA to fish).</p>

So, here it is: (a) You need to have <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> installed as the database backend for OpenERP. (b) OpenERP is written in python so you’ll need some packages for that part. (c) There is a server and a client. The server is important – client can be both a desktop client or a web client. (d) We’ll cover all of this except the web client. You don’t need that to get started. (e) We’re using OpenERP on Ubuntu 11.10 but an older version should also work.</p>

				<h2 class="post-title">Agent Mobility with JADE and JIPMS</h2>
			</a>
			<div class="post-date"><i class="icon-calendar"></i>Dec 29, 2011</div>
		</div>
		<div class="post"><p>A friend and I have been working on <em>Java Agent DEvelopment Framework (JADE)</em> for a while now. The idea is to enhance security mechanisms in the open source agent-deployment platform. The first step we decided to address was the actual mobility of an agent from one platform (in the sense of a dedicated machine running the JADE middleware) to another one. Turned out that it was much harder than one would imagine -- especially given the fact that these agents are supposed to be <em>mobile</em>. Anyway, after around two months of part-time efforts, we got the agent working. Since the whole ordeal involved a lot of missing documentation and bad support, I decided to document the process through this tutorial. So, here it is. Read on to see how you can create an agent on one platform, migrate it to another platform, have it do some computation there and come back to the source.&nbsp;</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>First, you're going to need two machines running Ubuntu. (We used Ubuntu 11.10 oneric for this.) If you only have one machine, you can install VirtualBox, setup a Ubuntu instance in a VM and connect it to the host through a virtual interface. I prefer using two adapters, first one set to a NAT setting and another one set to Host-only setting. This way, I get Internet connectivity in the guest as well as host-to-guest simple addressing.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>We're going to use JADE 3.6 along with the <em>JADE Inter-platform Mobility Service (JIPMS)</em> 1.2 for our needs. Download <a href="http://jade.tilab.com/" target="_blank">JADE</a> and <a href="https://tao.uab.cat/ipmp/" target="_blank">JIPMS</a>.&nbsp; I used jade-binary package and extracted it in /home/documents/jade. I also extracted the JIPMS and moved the file migration.jar from its lib folder to the lib folder of jade binary. This makes it easier for us to change the classpath later on. We'll need these files on both machines.</p>
<p>Now we need to setup the machines. Here are the details of the setup on each machine:</p>
<p><strong>Host:</strong></p>
<p>hostname: slave1<br />
IP: 192.168.56.1 (set by VirtualBox automatically)</p>
<p>You can get the IP addresses of each machine through the ifconfig command. Edit /etc/hosts to insert the other machine's address. My hosts file on slave1 looks like this:</p>
<p>[sourcecode language="bash"]<br />
# 127.0.0.1&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;     localhost<br />
127.0.0.1&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;     slave1<br />
192.168.56.101&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; slave2<br />
[/sourcecode]</p>
<p>Now, we can run jade using the following command:</p>
<p>[sourcecode language="bash"]<br />
java -cp lib/jade.jar:lib/migration.jar:lib/iiop.jar:<br />
         lib/jadeTools.jar:lib/http.jar:<br />
         lib/commons-codec/commons-codec-1.3.jar<br />
     jade.Boot<br />
         -gui<br />
         -platform-id slave1<br />
         -host slave1<br />
         -services jade.core.mobility.AgentMobilityService;<br />
                   jade.core.migration.InterPlatformMobilityService<br />
         -accept-foreign-agents true<br />
[/sourcecode]</p>
<p>You will need to use a little common sense about the line breaks and spaces here. I've formatted the command for highest readability. (Note the escaped ';' in the services param and the use of full colon instead of the semi-colon in the classpath. This is only required on *nix platforms.) Three switches are important here: platform-id, host and services.&nbsp; First two are self-explanatory. Third tells the IPMS to start the services that take care of the agent migration. We also need to enable the acceptance of foreign agents but I'm sure you already knew that from all the mailing list searches.</p>
<p><strong>Guest:</strong></p>
<p>hostname: slave2<br />
IP: 192.168.56.101 (set by VirtualBox automatically)<strong></strong></p>
<p>The hosts file looks like this:</p>
<p>[sourcecode language="bash"]<br />
# 127.0.0.1&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;   localhost<br />
127.0.0.1&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; slave2<br />
192.168.56.1&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; slave1<br />
[/sourcecode]</p>
<p>Start jade on slave2 using the following command:</p>
<p>[sourcecode language="bash"]<br />
java -cp lib/jade.jar:lib/migration.jar:lib/iiop.jar:<br />
         lib/jadeTools.jar:lib/http.jar:<br />
         lib/commons-codec/commons-codec-1.3.jar<br />
     jade.Boot<br />
        -gui<br />
        -platform-id slave2<br />
        -host slave2<br />
        -services jade.core.mobility.AgentMobilityService;<br />
                  jade.core.migration.InterPlatformMobilityService<br />
        -accept-foreign-agents true<br />
[/sourcecode]</p>
<p><strong>The Agent:</strong></p>
<p>Now, we turn to the actual agent code that does the migration. For this, we can setup eclipse and code from within that. The code for the agent is fairly straight-forward:</p>
<p>[sourcecode language="java"]<br />
package org.csrdu.mobility;</p>
<p>import jade.core.AID;<br />
import jade.core.Agent;<br />
import jade.core.PlatformID;<br />
import jade.core.behaviours.TickerBehaviour;</p>
<p>@SuppressWarnings(&quot;serial&quot;)<br />
public class MobileAgent extends Agent {</p>
<p>    @Override<br />
    protected void setup() {<br />
        super.setup();<br />
        addBehaviour(new MyTickerBehaviour(this, 1000));</p>
<p>        System.out.println(&quot;Hello World. I am an agent!&quot;);<br />
        System.out.println(&quot;My LocalName: &quot; + getAID().getLocalName());<br />
        System.out.println(&quot;My Name: &quot; + getAID().getName());<br />
        System.out.println(&quot;My Address: &quot; + getAID().getAddressesArray()[0]);<br />
    }</p>
<p>    private class MyTickerBehaviour extends TickerBehaviour {<br />
        Agent agent;<br />
        // long interval;<br />
        int counter;</p>
<p>        public MyTickerBehaviour(Agent agent, long interval) {<br />
            super(agent, interval);<br />
            this.agent = agent;<br />
            // this.interval = interval;<br />
        }</p>
<p>        @Override<br />
        protected void onTick() {<br />
            if (counter == 3) {<br />
                // move out<br />
                AID remoteAMS = new AID(&quot;ams@slave2&quot;, AID.ISGUID);<br />
                remoteAMS.addAddresses(&quot;http://slave2:7778/acc&quot;);<br />
                PlatformID destination = new PlatformID(remoteAMS);<br />
                agent.doMove(destination);<br />
            }<br />
            if (counter == 10) {<br />
                // move back<br />
                AID remoteAMS = new AID(&quot;ams@slave1&quot;, AID.ISGUID);<br />
                remoteAMS.addAddresses(&quot;http://slave1:7778/acc&quot;);<br />
                PlatformID destination = new PlatformID(remoteAMS);<br />
                agent.doMove(destination);<br />
            }<br />
            if (counter &lt; 15)<br />
                System.out.println(counter++);<br />
            else<br />
                agent.doDelete();<br />
        }</p>
<p>    }<br />
}<br />
[/sourcecode]</p>
<p>For the sake of completion, here's the arguments that you have to pass when running the agent code from within eclipse.</p>
<p>[sourcecode]<br />
-container -agents mob:org.csrdu.mobility.MobileAgent<br />
  -services jade.core.mobility.AgentMobilityService;jade.core.migration.InterPlatformMobilityService<br />
[/sourcecode]</p>
<p>Also, add all the jade and mobility jars to the build path of the project. I'm not sure which ones are needed here so you will have to figure that out on your own. </p>
<p><strong>Caveats:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>If you get this error:  <code>Destination slave2:1099/JADE does not exist or does not support mobility</code>, it most probably means that you (a) you don't have IPMS running, (b) you didn't put the -services switch properly (c) there's a firewall blocking your port 7778 or (d) your hostnames are messed up. In any case, the whole instructions above should work for you.
     </li>
<li>You will most probably need to change your /etc/hosts file and comment out the line that says '127.0.0.1 localhost'. It causes JADE to start the ams@slaveN service as http://localhost:7778/acc instead of http://slaveN:7778/acc and that means a lot of missed ACL messages and a lot of headaches. You usually get the dreaded <code>getContainerID() failed to find agent ams@slave1</code> error because of this. Do this for both the host and the guest. Make sure your JADE GUI looks like the following:<br />
<a href="http://recluze.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/rma_jade_slave.png"><img src="/assets/images/2011/12/rma_jade_slave.png" alt="" title="JADE GUI for AMS Address" width="586" height="393" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-784" /></a></li>
<li>Finally, if you need detailed logging, you can create the logging config file by the name of logging.properties given below and pass the <code>-Djava.util.logging.config.file=logging.properties</code> parameter when starting JADE. This will give much finer-grained logs. This is standard log4j syntax.

		<div class="post"><p>Varnish is an extremely easy to configure server cache software that can help you counter the ‘slashdot effect’ – high traffic over a small period of time. The way Varnish does this is by sitting between the client and the webserver and providing cached results to the client so that the server doesn’t have to process every page. It’s better than memcache etc because the request never gets to the webserver. You can avoid one of the bottlenecks this way. In this tutorial, we’ll cover how to setup Varnish on a VPS (or dedicated server) where you have root access and are running your site using cPanel/WHM. It also applies to situations where you don’t have cPanel/WHM. You can just skip the cPanel portion if that’s the case. So, let’s get started.</p>

			</a>
			<div class="post-date"><i class="icon-calendar"></i>Jun 25, 2010</div>
		</div>
		<div class="post"><p><strong>Update:</strong> If you are interested in getting a running start to machine learning and deep learning, I have created a course that I'm offering to my dedicated readers for just $9.99. <a href="https://www.udemy.com/practical-deep-learning-with-keras/?couponCode=RECLYBLOG" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Access it here on Udemy</a>. If you are only here for Matlab, continue reading =]</p>
<p>I just finished writing my first machine learning algorithm in Matlab. The algorithm is based on gradient descent search for estimating parameters of linear regression (but can be easily extended to quadratic or even higher-dimensional polynomials). It's fairly easy if you know the theory behind the model. So, first a very brief theory portion. This isn't a tutorial on statistics. Go read a book if you don't know about regression.</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<p>Just to recall: Regression comes in when you want to estimate a response variable ($latex y$) given explanatory variables ($latex x_i$). The goal for linear regression is to come up with values for <em>parameters</em> ($latex \theta_i$) such that you get a 'best possible fit' for each jth instance in the dataset of m instances:</p>
<p>$latex y^j = \sum_{i=1}^m{\theta_i \times x_i^j}$</p>
<p>In matrix notation, that comes simply to:</p>
<p>$latex Y = \theta^T X$</p>
<p>(For ease, we assume that $latex x_1$ is a vector of all 1s thus making $latex \theta_1$ the y-intercept).</p>
<p>The idea of gradient descent is to come up with the best (locally) values of $latex \theta$. It does this by repeatedly updating the value of $latex \theta$ using the formula:</p>
<p>$latex \theta_i = \theta_i - \alpha * \sum_{j=1}^m{(\theta^T X^j - Y^j) X_i^j}$</p>
<p>If you have no idea what this is or if you want to know this in-depth, read till the end.</p>
<p>Here's the Matlab code for this whole procedure I wrote at first. Note the use of W for $latex \theta$:</p>

We don’t have a supported carrier here and we couldn’t get our own carriers to work with Android because we didn’t have the APN information. Android’s distro that comes bundled into the Dev Phone won’t let you in without an APN  though. You get a “SIM not found” message and you can’t do anything other than dial an emergency number. So, after searching for a while, I found some useful tips for getting around the problem.</p>

I still stand by the first opinion but I’m not so sure about getting things done. The problem is mostly the people here. They’re not only ignorant and non-professional, they’re also selfish – this is what annoys me the most. Many people tell me that it’s because of the poverty but I don’t buy that. Most of the people I know are not poor. They’re pretty well-off. They drive expensive cars, they have big homes, they’ve never gone unfed. They still act like there’s a famine coming and if they don’t collect all the money/stuff, they’re going to die of hunger.</p>

		<div class="post"><h2><span class="mw-headline">Difference between SVN and GIT </span></h2>
<p><em>The usual answer</em>: SVN is to GIT what revision control is to distributed versioning system. What in the crack pot is that supposed to mean? The answer is pretty simple: a revision control system keeps the whole revision meta-data in 'one place'. A _distributed_ versioning system allows different developers/users/programmers/organizations create different repositories of their own and merge them to a central server as they see fit. They can even keep the changes to themselves (but that's not the point of it). So, there you go. If you get code off Android's git repo and make changes as you see fit. You can commit changes to your local repo, have revisions, do whatever and keep the changes to yourself. If Android was using SVN and you used that, you'd have to go through a lot of trouble trying to keep the changes to yourself while still using the revisions of Android team.</p>
<p><a name="Some_important_concepts"></a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline"> Some important concepts </span></h2>
<p><strong>Clone</strong></p>
<p>When you clone a repo, you take the whole metadata of a remote git repository and store it locally. For example, when you get clone the Android repo from git, you get the meta-data of the whole source in a local repo. (You have to pull the changes to get the actual source, though.)</p>
<p><strong>Commit</strong></p>
<p>When you make a change, you can 'commit' the change and that change gets stored as a revision. A commit in git is recognized by a SHA-1 hash.</p>
<p><strong>Branches</strong></p>
<p>A branch is a specific sequence of commits. An example: The source code is at A, you make some changes and commit to B, then to C and then to D. Afterwards, you create a new branch, switch to this branch, make some changes and commit to P, make some more changes and commit to Q. The revision history would look like so:</p>
<pre>                    P --- Q
                   /
A --- B --- C --- D</pre>
<p>See why it's called a 'branch'?</p>
<p><strong>Pull</strong></p>
<p>A basic pull is simple. It gets the files from the remote git repo and puts them in the local repo. Things get messy when you've actually pulled once, made changes and committed them in the local repo. Let's see how this goes: Taking the previous example of branch further: You cloned a repo at D. You made some changes and now, you're at Q. However, while you were busy making changes upto Q, the rest of the world wasn't asleep. They worked too and they got upto G. Of course, you didn't tell them what you were doing. So, their repo looks like so:</p>
<pre>A --- B --- C --- D --- E --- F --- G</pre>
<p>Now, you're in trouble because you have old copies of some files. You need to get to G without losing changes of Q. You 'pull' and git sees that you've made some changes and upates the repo to look like this:</p>
<pre>                                      P' --- Q'
                                     /
A --- B --- C --- D --- E --- F ---
G
</pre>

It is my opinion that Jobs is about to leave Apple for good. They just wanted to soften the blow by letting him take a small leave instead of announcing the big departure. Stocks fell even as a result of this and even a rumour of a departure may have been catastrophic. Anyway, it seems that Steve Jobs will be gone and so will the era of desktop computing. Google’s often termed as the new Microsoft. The position for the new Apple is open and <a href="http://www.android.com">Android</a> seems to be putting Google in <em>that</em> position as well. Is this going to be a single super-power situation?</p>

		</div>
		<div class="post"><p>I couldn't find a straight forward tutorial on how to create an LPM in SELinux. So, here goes. Notice that this is for educational purposes only and would only take you so far. You need to study the implications of LPMs and how SELinux works before you can actually use them.</p>
<p><strong>Assumptions: </strong></p>
<ol>
<li>You know what SELinux is.</li>
<li>You know what types, attributes, macros etc are in SELinux.</li>
<li>You have read about Loadable Policy Modules (LPMs) and want to use them.</li>
<li>You don't know how to write and compile/use an LPM.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Setup:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Set SELinux to permissive. (Not enforcing. This isn't a complete tutorial!)</li>
<li>Get <em>setools</em> package (possibly from yum)</li>
<li>Install <em>selinux-policy-devel</em> package (possibly from yum)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Operations</strong>: (<em>su</em> whenever you need to)</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a directory. I'm assuming /home/user/lpm</li>
<li>cd into the directory and create a sample policy. (See below for policy where it will be explained). Let's call it <em>myapp.te</em></li>
<li>Copy the LPM makefile from /usr/share/selinux/devel. (This comes with selinux-policy-devel)</li>
<li>Run "make"  &lt; compiles the .te file</li>
<li>Run "semodule -i myapp.pp"&lt; loads the LPM</li>
<li>Run "cp /usr/bin/tail ./tt2" &lt; copies the tail script here for testing purposes</li>

Most tests I’ve seen are more about understanding of English than about intelligence. This one (although I still don’t see how a test can measure intelligence) is far better. Take the “Ultimate IQ Test” and see if you score higher than me. I got a 139 last time I took it. Do tell me if you even attempt the “Test for Exceptional Intelligence”. That one’s sure to give you a headache. <a href="http://www.highiqsociety.org/flash/nonmembers/iqtests.htm"><br />
