          <p>For the first time in my life, I’m having second thoughts about living in Pakistan. I’ve always argued that there’s no shortage of opportunities or resources in Pakistan and that if someone wanted to work here, it can be done. I still stand by the first opinion but I’m not so sure about getting things done. The problem is mostly the people here. They’re not only ignorant and non-professional, they’re also selfish – this is what annoys me the most. Many people tell me that it’s because of the poverty but I don’t buy that. Most of the people I know are not poor. They’re pretty well-off. They drive expensive cars, they have big homes, they’ve never gone unfed. They still act like there’s a famine coming and if they don’t collect all the money/stuff, they’re going to die of hunger.</p>

<p>It doesn’t stop there either. We’re all so rigid that we’re not willing to let go of things that we don’t even need. Try standing in a line and see how much space you get. Everyone will be trying to push you, for reasons known only to them. Of course, I’m not counting those who cut lines to get things done quickly because they’re so busy.</p>

<p>I’m not good at writing this stuff so this post probably doesn’t convey the extent of my frustration. I’m not up to the point of trying to find a job abroad but I’m getting there. I still like it here – I’m just not sure how much more I can stand.</p>
