Like SACMAT08, this was exhilarating due to the amount of effort it requires just to get each and every sentence right and to fit everything in the allocated space. As expected, I can’t much say about the submission itself but this one was my idea and I was responsible for the whole thing.</p>

<p>We think the idea is really good and we presented it real well. But of course, with CCS, all bets are off.</p>
