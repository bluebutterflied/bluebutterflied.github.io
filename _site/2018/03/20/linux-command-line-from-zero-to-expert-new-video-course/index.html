          <p>I have a new video course that helps aspiring computer scientists excel in almost any area that they decide to pursue by teaching them about the Linux command line – one of the best investments in time anyone working with computers can make.</p>

<p>The course is for beginners but even has something for people who’ve had a little prior experience with the command line.</p>

<p>For my blog readers, I’m making it available for just $9.99 (with a 30-day money back guarantee). Use the following link to get your discount: <a href="https://www.udemy.com/linux-command-line-zero-to-expert/?couponCode=RECLYBLOG999">Linux Command Line - From Zero to Expert</a></p>

<p>Once you know about the command line, you will be in a position to learn much more interesting stuff such as Linux system administration, VoIP and many more.</p>
