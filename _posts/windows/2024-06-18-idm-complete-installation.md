Internet Download Manager is one of the most famous download manager out there. The installation process can be sometime difficult for new users. In some-cases even if you know the installation still the software don't work. Let's get rid of this issue and install a working internet download manager.

## Pre-Requisite

First of all i've uploaded the `IDM full complete.rar` on drive. You've to download it initially or get it from a friend in pen-drive. After getting the file in your computer, you've to follow some pre-instructions.

* Disable Antivirus
* Disable Windows Defender

## Initial Extraction

After it, simply extract the `IDM full complete.rar` file. In it, go to the `_Getintopc.com_Internet_Download_Manager_6.41_Build_3` folder. It will have a folder Setup_Install, open it. There will be a file `Setup_install.exe` in it. Simply click it and select next-next options. It will make a new file `idman641build3f.exe`. This is the main installation file. Simply open it and click next-next untill it installs. 

## Registration

Now that your installation if finished. It will say that **"IDM is not registered"**. Go to the `Crack/Patch v18.1` folder. Click on the `Patch.exe` file. Then simply press the `crack` button on this cracker.

## http/1.1 403 forbidden issue

Now that your IDM is registered but still it will give `http forbidden` error if you download from **YOUTUBE**. Now turn on your internet. Open IDM and go to help section from the top bar. In it, select the about menu. There will be option for check for updates, click it and next-next buttons to auto-download and install the latest version. 

Now your IDM has the latest version, it will again ask for activation. This time go to `IDM_6.4x_Crack_v19.7` directory. Click on `IDM_6.4x_Crack_v19.7.exe` again click on the `crack` button of the cracker. It will say something like `OK>Reboot`. Now you can reboot the pc for complete healthy startup for IDM(In my case, i didn't reboot but the software was working totally fine).

## Adding IDM Extension on Browser

The final step is to add `IDM extension`. Simply open this link here [EXTENSION-LINK](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/idm-integration-module/ngpampappnmepgilojfohadhhmbhlaek). Click on `Add to Chrome` button. It will add the IDM extension on chrome(do this same process if you want to use any other browser).

Your IDM Installation is complete. For testing purpose, open any youtube video, a pop-up of `Download this video` will appear. Click on it and press the `Start Downloading` button. The download wil start and will be complete in the estimated time given.

This was the complete process of IDM installation which i tested and ran on multiple computers. I hope this post will be helpful for you. Cheers!
