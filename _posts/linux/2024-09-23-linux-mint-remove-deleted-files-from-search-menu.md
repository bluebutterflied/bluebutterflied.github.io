I personally use the Windows Key shortcut to open up the start menu and search for the applications from there, usually i pin the most used apps in the start. Recently when i was using the menu, i saw this thing of recently opened files displaying there. I mean those files which you used earlier in the past 7 days appear at start and can be disturbing to your workflow. 

Gadly i've found a solution for it. Simply follow the guide-line. First of all press window button and search for system settings. It will look like this,

Then in the preferences section, go to privacy, you'll see these options,

Simply turn off the first option of `remember recently accessed files`,

and you are done, your recently opened files will not contradict with the pre-added shortcuts via alphabet typing.
