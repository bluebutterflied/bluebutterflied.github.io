Well, today i'm uploading the recomendation letter which i recieved just few hours back from my Professor `Dr Hafeez Ur Rehman`.

Dr Hafeez Ur Rehman is the Head Of Department of Computer Science in our university (**FAST NUCES PESHAWAR**). I've completed my course of Artifical Intelligence with him last semester(**6th**). I've defended an **A** in his course. Due to my performance in the course and on my request of recomendation letter to him, he provided me one yesterday.

Alhamdulillah this letter will not only explain my performance but also keep me motivated to learn new skills.

Below is the attached recommendation letter.
