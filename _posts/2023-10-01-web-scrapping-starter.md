Web Scrapping involves the scraping (collecting) data. As we are aware data is widely used for variety of purposes. From predictions to model training, everywhere data is involved. We get data from various sources i.e internet, local drives e.t.c. One of the modern way of collecting data is known as Web Scraping.

Web Scrapping is performed by different frameworks or libraries in different programming languages but we are going to mainly use python for webscrapping as it's easy and more convinient to use.

Three main tools used for doing web scrapping are as below:
1. Beautiful Soup
2. Selenium
3. Scrappy

Question is "which one is the best?" We get the answer soon when we start using these tools.
