title: Kick Off with Jekyll Static Site via Cloning Recluze Repository
---
Today, i used the site of my Professor Muhammad Nauman (recluze). I used his github repository. After reducing its content, i've created my clone for my work sharing and portfolio platform. I hope, it will go well.

I'm going to share some more details soon. Till that, sit back and relax.

Good Luck!
