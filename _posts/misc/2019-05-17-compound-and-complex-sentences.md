Here is an old blog of mine from wordpress site. I did write some types of sentences with examples in it. It was an assignment for my friend. As i left the wordpress so i though to keep this blog as a memory here. It was quite useful at that time, it might be for some people now. Anyways, hope you'll get to know something from it.

## Compound Sentences:

A compound sentence is a sentence that connects two independent clauses generally by using coordinating conjunctions.

## Complex Sentences:

A complex sentence is a sentence with one independent clause and at least one dependent clause.

## Consider a Paragraph:

Susan was dining alone. She was uncomfortable, and she hid her face in a book. When she looked up, she saw the most handsome man she had ever seen. After he joined her, she knew it was love at first sight, and it was not long before they were married.

## Consider another paragraph:

Sunset is the time of day when our sky meets the outer space solar winds. There are blue, pink, and purple swirls, spinning and twisting, like clouds of balloons caught in a whirlwind. The sun moves slowly to hide behind the line of the horizon, while the moon races to take its place in prominence atop the night sky. People slow to a crawl, entranced, fully forgetting the deeds that must still be done. There is a coolness, a calmness when the sun does set.

On July 16, 1969, the Apollo 11 spacecraft launched from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Its mission was to go where no human being had gone before—the moon! The crew consisted of Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins, and Buzz Aldrin. The spacecraft landed on the moon in the Sea of Tranquility, a basaltic flood plain, on July 20, 1969. The moonwalk took place the following day. On July 21, 1969, at precisely 10:56 EDT, Commander Neil Armstrong emerged from the Lunar Module and took his famous first step onto the moon’s surface. He declared, “That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.” It was a monumental moment in human history!

## Have a look at another paragraph:

Oceans and lakes have much in common, but they are also quite different. Both are bodies of water, but oceans are very large bodies of saltwater, while lakes are much smaller bodies of freshwater. Lakes are usually surrounded by land, while oceans are what surround continents. Both have plants and animals living in them.
