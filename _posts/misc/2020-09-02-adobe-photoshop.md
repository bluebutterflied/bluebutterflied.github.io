Adobe Photoshop is one of the finest graphical editors that is widely being used in the world. It is being developed by the well-known software development company Adobe. The Adobe 7.0 was the version of Photoshop that had boosted this franchise to another level. Now the company has developed a much more reliable and advanced version of Photoshop. 

Currently different big industries including the filming industry, gaming industry, and music industry are widely using Adobe Photoshop for their work.

## Pannels:

Pannel is the place where your work happens. Photoshop basically works on the basis of layers. These layers are present in the panels. In addition to it, we can add effects to the documents using panels. Panels can also be used to keep the record of every single step that you do on a document. Here is a preview of the Panel,

So this was all the basic infrastructure of Adobe Photoshop. I will discuss these menus further in the next blogs.
