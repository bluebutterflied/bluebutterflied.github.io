I"†<p>Generally <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Back-Propagation</code> is the main algorithm to train the neural network but before it, we need to do a forward pass which is known as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Forward Propagation</code>. Inputs are given through input layer with the weights. Simple linear algebra which includes matrix multiplication is used.</p>

<p>We need to know how a neural network predict. For this purpose we need to understand the flow. Initially youâ€™ve to identify the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">total trainable parameters</code>. Here in this case we have 4 inputs and 3 hiddens layers. Find the total connections,</p>

<p>This forward pass will be used to check the prediction. In the back the dot product b/w the inputs and weights is taken place with addition with the bias.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>input*weights+bias
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Here is the full calculations,</p>

<p>To understand the full flow in one go. Iâ€™ve solved a complete example with all mathematical calculations. Youâ€™ll get enough idea from it.</p>

<p>The ouput of first hidden layer will become input for the next hidden layer,</p>
