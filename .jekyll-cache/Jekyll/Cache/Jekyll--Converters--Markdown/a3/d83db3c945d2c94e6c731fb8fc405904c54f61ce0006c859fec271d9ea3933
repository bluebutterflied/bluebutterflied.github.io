I"Ê<p>PHP and HTML are totally different languages. PHP is a server-side language while the HTML is a client-side language. However the interaction between these two is very important. We make the interface in html while and we write the logic in php. The simple example of it is the sign-up boxes. They are made in html, while the username and password we enter in the fields is taken to server via the use of php. So both of them are of equal importance.</p>
