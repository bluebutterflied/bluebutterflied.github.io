I"9<p>There are some problems which cannot be solved with a sequential model, therefore we need non-sequential model. Sequential model goes on with the assumption of single input and single output. What if youâ€™ve to predict two things? What if linear topology doesnot solve your problem.</p>

<p>In order to make non-sequential model, we use keras-functional-api. First of all import the model from keras,</p>
