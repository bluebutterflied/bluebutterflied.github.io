I"~<p>React is one of the readily used framework when it comes to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">web</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mobile</code>  application developmenmt. So far, iâ€™ve seen two ways of working in react. The first one is the basic one with 
node pakage execute <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">npx</code> which will give you the all react framework files and the second one
is with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vite</code>. Vite provide you the light files structure by excluding all the un-necessary react 
files at the start.</p>
