I"<p>Function are one of the most important component of any programming language. Function is basically a block of code that you want to use repeatidly. Function have two major things.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Function Declaration</li>
  <li>Function Call</li>
</ul>

<p>Function is declared initially and later on it is called whenever needed. There are two main types of functions,</p>

<ul>
  <li>Built-in Functions</li>
  <li>User-defined Functions</li>
</ul>

<p>Built-in functions are prebuild in language and we use them by giving a simple function call. The most common example of built-in function is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">var_dump()</code>. Secondly the user-defined functions are defined by user himself. The syntax of defining a function in php is very simple. You simple have to write <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">function</code> keyword then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">function_name</code> and after it you write small parenthesis <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">()</code> and following it comes the pair of curly braces <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{}</code>.</p>

<p>There are multiple functions if you categorize them on the basis of their functionality. Iâ€™m listing some of them,</p>

<ul>
  <li>Built-in Function</li>
  <li>User-defined Function</li>
  <li>Simple Function</li>
  <li>Returning Value Function</li>
  <li>Anonymous Function</li>
  <li>Parameterize Function</li>
  <li>Variable Function</li>
</ul>
