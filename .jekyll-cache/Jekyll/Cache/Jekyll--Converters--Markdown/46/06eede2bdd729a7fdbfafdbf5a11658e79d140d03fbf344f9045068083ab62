I"‡<p>Transfer learning is also one of the most important topic in Deep-Learning/Machine-Learning. I would say it is like using others pre-trained models for your problem. Deep Learning models are difficult to train because they are data-hungry. By this i mean they require alot of data in order to achieve good performance. Therefore is alot of data you can say labelled-data is required.</p>
