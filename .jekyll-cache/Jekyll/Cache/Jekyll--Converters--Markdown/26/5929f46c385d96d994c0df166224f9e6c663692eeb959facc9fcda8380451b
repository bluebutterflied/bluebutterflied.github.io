I"Á<p>By default if youâ€™ve multiple Disk-Drives or partitions, either in NTFS or FAT partition system, linux donot automatically mount them. Youâ€™ve to mount the partition everytime manually which is honestly way too headache for a lazy person like me. Why not solve this issue and do some configurations so that on boot the linux automatically mount all the disk-drives.</p>

<p>For this purpose youâ€™ve to add your drives in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fstab</code> file,</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo nano /etc/fstab
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here youâ€™ll see already added the linux drives by default. In my case iâ€™ve 4 NTFS partitions from my Windows-Drive and i want to mount them automatically on startup. Iâ€™ll add the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UUID</code> of the drives in this text file.</p>

<p>Simply open your disk management application on your linux (Iâ€™m using linux mint and also iâ€™ve tried the same method on ubuntu, works totally fine for me).</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve 4 Hard-Drives. The last one is this linux itself so ignore it and lets focus on the first 3. Click on the first Drive and youâ€™ll see something like this,</p>
