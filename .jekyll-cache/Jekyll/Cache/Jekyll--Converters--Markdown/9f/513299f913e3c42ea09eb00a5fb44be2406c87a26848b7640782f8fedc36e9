In some-cases even if you know the installation still the software don‚Äôt work. Let‚Äôs get rid of this issue and install a working internet download manager.</p>

<h2 id="pre-requisite">Pre-Requisite</h2>

<p>First of all i‚Äôve uploaded the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IDM full complete.rar</code> on drive. You‚Äôve to download it initially or get it from a friend in pen-drive. After getting the file in your computer, you‚Äôve to follow some pre-instructions.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Disable Antivirus</li>
  <li>Disable Windows Defender</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="initial-extraction">Initial Extraction</h2>

<p>After it, simply extract the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IDM full complete.rar</code> file. In it, go to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_Getintopc.com_Internet_Download_Manager_6.41_Build_3</code> folder. It will have a folder Setup_Install, open it. There will be a file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Setup_install.exe</code> in it. Simply click it and select next-next options. It will make a new file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">idman641build3f.exe</code>. This is the main installation file. Simply open it and click next-next untill it installs.</p>

<h2 id="registration">Registration</h2>

<p>Now that your installation if finished. It will say that <strong>‚ÄúIDM is not registered‚Äù</strong>. Go to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Crack/Patch v18.1</code> folder. Click on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Patch.exe</code> file. Then simply press the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">crack</code> button on this cracker.</p>

<p>Now that your IDM is registered but still it will give <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http forbidden</code> error if you download from <strong>YOUTUBE</strong>. Now turn on your internet. Open IDM and go to help section from the top bar. In it, select the about menu. There will be option for check for updates, click it and next-next buttons to auto-download and install the latest version.</p>

<p>Now your IDM has the latest version, it will again ask for activation. This time go to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IDM_6.4x_Crack_v19.7</code> directory. Click on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IDM_6.4x_Crack_v19.7.exe</code> again click on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">crack</code> button of the cracker. It will say something like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OK&gt;Reboot</code>. Now you can reboot the pc for complete healthy startup for IDM(In my case, i didn‚Äôt reboot but the software was working totally fine).</p>

<p>The final step is to add <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IDM extension</code>. Simply open this link here <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/idm-integration-module/ngpampappnmepgilojfohadhhmbhlaek">EXTENSION-LINK</a>. Click on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Add to Chrome</code> button. It will add the IDM extension on chrome(do this same process if you want to use any other browser).</p>

<p>Your IDM Installation is complete. For testing purpose, open any youtube video, a pop-up of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Download this video</code> will appear. Click on it and press the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Start Downloading</code> button. The download wil start and will be complete in the estimated time given.</p>

<p>This was the complete process of IDM installation which i tested and ran on multiple computers. I hope this post will be helpful for you. Cheers!</p>
