I"<p>Transferring an old blog from wordpress to here. When i was a “Freshie” in my university. We used to write some blogs on basic topics. One day i was sitting in COLAB(A sort of working environment not the literal LAB) and i was not getting any idea about what to write so i choose the simplest topic haha Computers, Hardwares and Softwares and wrote a hole blog on it. I found it on the other site which i don’t use so i thought to put it here more like a memory.</p>

<p>A computer is being widely used now a days. Infact in every sector, every aspect of life. They have made the working of human too easy. Now a days almost 90 percent of the human tasks are completed by computers and only 10 percents are being done by humans themselves. This is showing that how much the computer has become important in the life of human. A computer performs many functions but i’m going to point out few here.</p>
