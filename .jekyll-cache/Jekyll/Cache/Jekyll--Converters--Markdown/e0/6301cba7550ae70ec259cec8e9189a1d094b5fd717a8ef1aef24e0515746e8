I"ı<p>It is a fast go-through for the installation procedure of Android-Studio in all linux platforms. In my case i‚Äôm using linux mint but the method works for all distributions.</p>

<p>First of all download the android studio from this link <a href="https://redirector.gvt1.com/edgedl/android/studio/ide-zips/2024.1.1.13/android-studio-2024.1.1.13-linux.tar.gz">‚ÄúClick Here To Download.‚Äù</a> By this the tar.gz file will start downloading. After the download is complete, it will look like this,</p>

<p>Open the file and extract the folder present within it.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/clt/android-studio-installation-in-linux/2.png" alt="2" /></p>

<p>Now go to this directory and within it open the bin directory. Here open up the terminal and write this command,</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>./studio
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Installer will open and you simply have to follow along by pressing the next button. Eventually the downloading of the packages will start and after it, they‚Äôll be installed automatically. Now that the installation is finished, you now have a shortcut of android-studio in the start menu. Click on it and application will launch,</p>
