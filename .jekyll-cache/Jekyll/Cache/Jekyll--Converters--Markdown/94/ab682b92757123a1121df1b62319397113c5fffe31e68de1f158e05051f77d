I"5<p>I use the Windows operating system mainly for playing video games. Recently i faced this issue of disk space auto filling up whenever the os got updates resulting in lower remaining space in the os drive. Eventually iâ€™ve to replace the windows with a new one every 2 or 3 years which was a headache.</p>
