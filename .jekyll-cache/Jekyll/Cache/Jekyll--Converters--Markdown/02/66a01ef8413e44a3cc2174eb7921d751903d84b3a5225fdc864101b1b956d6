<h2 id="pannels">Pannels:</h2>

<p>Pannel is the place where your work happens. Photoshop basically works on the basis of layers. These layers are present in the panels. In addition to it, we can add effects to the documents using panels. Panels can also be used to keep the record of every single step that you do on a document. Here is a preview of the Panel,</p>

<p>So this was all the basic infrastructure of Adobe Photoshop. I will discuss these menus further in the next blogs.</p>
