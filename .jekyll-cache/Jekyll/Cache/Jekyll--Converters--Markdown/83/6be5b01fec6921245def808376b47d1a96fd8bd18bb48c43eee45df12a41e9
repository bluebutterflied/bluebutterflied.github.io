I"Ã<p>In simple words, natural language processing is the combination of 3 things. Linguistics, Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. It is concerned with the interactions between computers and human language. This question came in mind what was the need of nlp? Humans are unable to communicate to computers in native languages and nlp is briding this gap.</p>

<p>There are multiple real world applications of nlp,</p>

<ul>
  <li>Contextual Advertisements</li>
  <li>Email Clients - spam filtering, smart reply</li>
  <li>Social Media - removing adult content, opinion mining</li>
  <li>Search Engines</li>
  <li>Chatbots</li>
</ul>

<p>Apart of these applications, nlp is performing a wide variety of tasks like</p>

<ul>
  <li>text/document classification</li>
  <li>sentiment  analysis</li>
  <li>information retrieval</li>
  <li>parts of speech tagging</li>
