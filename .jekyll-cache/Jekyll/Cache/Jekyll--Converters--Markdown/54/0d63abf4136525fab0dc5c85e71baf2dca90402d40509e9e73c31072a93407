<h2 id="types-of-shells">Types of Shells:</h2>

<p>Different types of shells are used for different tasks. It totally depends upon the nature of application. Shell decides how can we execute programs and which system resources should be access. Some common tpes of shells are below:</p>

</ol>

<p>We are going to look into the bash shell mainly as iâ€™m using linux and bash shell is widely used in it. Letâ€™s write some basic hello world shell script by using a hello.sh file.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello Shell"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After it, we have to check the permissions of the hello.sh file so that we can execute this script. For this purpose, we will add execution permission for this <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.sh file</code></p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>chmod +x hello.sh
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, confirm the permissions of the file by,</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>ls -l
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As the file is now executable, run the file by using,</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>./hello.sh
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and here you go. A message of â€œ<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Hello Shell"</code> is in front of you.</p>
