I"¡<p>Today, iâ€™m going to introduce you to pythonâ€™s Tupple Unpacking, Lambda function and Filter function. We are also going to discuss some Methods in python. These are widely used when working with python. Iâ€™m going to discuss each one by one.</p>

<p>First of all, when it comes to lambda expressions, they are one of the powerful feature in python. They are basically a functions that can be defined in single line, making code more concise and clean. Below is the example of lamba function in python, to double a variable.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>times2 = lambda var: var * 2
result = times2(6)  # This will give you 12

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Lambda expressions are commonly used when working with lists and Pandas library. Below is the example, in which we are using the lambda function with the â€˜<strong>mapâ€™</strong> funtion to perform operation on every element of a list.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>seq = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
doubled_seq = list(map(lambda num: num * 2, seq))

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now talking about â€˜<strong>filterâ€™</strong> function. It is also very handy tool in python. It allows you to filter elements from a list based on a specified condition. Below is the example of filter expression to filter even numbers from a sequence. You can use a lambda expression with filter function.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>seq = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
even_numbers = list(filter(lambda num: num % 2 == 0, seq))

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This function takes values from the list, applies the provided condition, and returns the values that satisfy it. To obtain a more readable result, wrap the <strong>filter</strong> function with the <strong>list</strong> function.</p>
