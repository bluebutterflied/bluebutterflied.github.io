I"¬<p>This question always come to mind. Why RNNS are needed when you have CNNs and ANNs? RNNs stand for Recurrent Neural Networks. Itâ€™s a type of neural network most suited for Natural Language Processing tasks. They are used to deal with Sequential Data thatâ€™s why they are better known as sequential models. You may ask what is sequential data. The data in which following the order is must is known as sequential data</p>
