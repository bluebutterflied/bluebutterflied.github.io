I"J<p>When it comes to machine learning, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Scikit Learn</code> is the most widely used library. Today, we are going to practice the very basic machine learning model. We are going to use scikit learn to split our data into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">train</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">test</code> subsets. Then we are going to create the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Linear Regression</code> model and afterwards, we train and test it by using the subsets.</p>
