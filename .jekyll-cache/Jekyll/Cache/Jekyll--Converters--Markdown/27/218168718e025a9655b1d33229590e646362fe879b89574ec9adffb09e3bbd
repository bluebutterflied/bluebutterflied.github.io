I"c<p>Generally <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Back-Propagation</code> is the main algorithm to train the neural network but before it, we need to do a forward pass which is known as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Forward Propagation</code>. Inputs are given through input layer with the weights. Simple linear algebra which includes matrix multiplication is used.</p>

<p>We need to know how a neural network predict. For this purpose we need to understand the flow. Initially youâ€™ve to identify the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">total trainable parameters</code>. Here in this case we have 4 inputs and 3 hiddens layers. Find the total connections,</p>
