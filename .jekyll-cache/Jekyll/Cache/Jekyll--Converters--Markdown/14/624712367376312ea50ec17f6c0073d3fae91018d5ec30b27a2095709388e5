I"ñ<p>Lately i was faced this issue on linux mint search menu. I personally use the Windows Key shortcut to open up the start menu and search for the applications from there, usually i pin the most used apps in the start. 
Recently when i was using the menu, i saw this thing of recently opened files displaying there. I mean those files which you used earlier in the past 7 days appear at start and can my disturb your workflow of opening multiple applications. Gadly i found a solution for it.</p>
