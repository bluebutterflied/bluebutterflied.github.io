I"ÿ<p>Here iâ€™ve discussed the complete Architecture of Gated Recurrent Unit. This is a type of RNN pretty similar to LSTM but a bit faster from the LSTM. Although it outperforms the LSTM in some problems while there are some cases where you still need to use LSTMâ€™s. It is better to test out both techniques to find good results on your problem.</p>
