I"_<p>Here i’ve discussed the complete Architecture of Gated Recurrent Unit. This is a type of RNN pretty similar to LSTM but a bit faster from the LSTM. Although it outperforms the LSTM in some problems while there are some cases where you still need to use LSTM’s. It is better to test out both techniques to find good results on your problem.</p>
