<p>React is one of the readily used framework when it comes to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">web</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mobile</code> developmenmt.</p>

<p>So far, i’ve seen two ways of working in react. The first one is the basic one with 
node pakage execute <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">npx</code> which will give you the all react framework files and the second one
is with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vite</code>. Vite provide you the light files structure by excluding all the un-necessary react 
files at the start.</p>

<p>We’ll focus on react via using the vite. It is much more reliable and easy to download as all
the files are downloaded in few minutes.</p>

<p>Initially write this on terminal to create the vite project.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>npm create vite@latest
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It will ask you to select b/w multiple frameworks. You’ve to select <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">react</code> among them. Then you’ve to select from the programming languages. 
There will be multiple options e.g Javascript, Typescript. We will go with the Javascript. Then, mention the project name and you are good to go.</p>

<p>You now have the vite react project in your computer. It have multiple files. Initially you have the 3 main files:</p>

<ul>
  <li>index.html</li>
  <li>app.jsx</li>
  <li>main.jsx</li>
</ul>

<p>In <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">index.html</code> you have your starting root (starting of the DOM). This root will be called from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main.jsx</code> component.
&lt;!– Well, today i’m uploading the recomendation letter which i recieved just few hours back from my Professor <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Dr Hafeez Ur Rehman</code>.</p>

<p>Dr Hafeez Ur Rehman is the Head Of Department of Computer Science in our university (<strong>FAST NUCES PESHAWAR</strong>). I’ve completed my course of Artifical Intelligence with him last semester(<strong>6th</strong>). I’ve defended an <strong>A</strong> in his course. Due to my performance in the course and on my request of recomendation letter to him, he provided me one yesterday.</p>

<p>Alhamdulillah this letter will not only explain my performance but also keep me motivated to learn new skills.</p>

<p>Below is the attached recommendation letter.</p>
