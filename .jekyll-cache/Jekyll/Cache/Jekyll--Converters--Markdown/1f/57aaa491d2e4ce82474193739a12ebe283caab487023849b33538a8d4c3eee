<p>The environment that iâ€™m using now a days is Jupyter Notebook. Jupyter notebook is a simplified notebook. That executes the python code line by line or you can say cell by cell. Also, you should know that python is a interpreted language. Its code run line by line.</p>

<p>If you are a beginner, you should install Anaconda. Anaconda will install python as well as jupyter notebook.</p>

<p>Apart from code, we can also write text in jupyter notebook. Jupyter notebook have a type of cell known as Markdown Cell. By using these markdown cells, you can also create presentations. Markdown cells are also usied to give headings e.t.c.</p>

<p>In order to execute a cell in jupyter notebook. You have to use short-cut of Shift+Enter. Also, in order to execute a cell and create a new cell below the current one, use the shortcute of ALT+ENTER. Third way is of Cntro+Enter, this one is used when you want to execute the current cell and want to stay on the same cell.</p>
