<!-- ## Research Statement

My research is along two main lines. My primary work is regarding application of Artificial Intelligence concepts in practical scenarios of Software Engineering practice. The primary scope of my work is the world wide web and software engineering concepts related to quality attributes such as usability, security and safety. My research work in MS is about usability in search in the context of social networks.

The area of my research aimed at security is related to the application of Artificial Intelligence concepts (such as theorem provers) through formal specification and verification of security protocols and frameworks. I work with Isabelle theorem prover and Z notation for computer supported modeling and reasoning of these frameworks. Recently, my focus has shifted to security on the smartphone platforms, specifically Android. I am currently working on usage control and attestation of this immensely popular smartphone software stack.

My aim through this research is not only to contribute to the global knowledge but also to enable the local market and industry in development and utilization of better techniques and technologies. -->

<h2 id="research-statement">Research Statement</h2>

<p>I am a highly motivated and dedicated student currently pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at the National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences (FAST) in Pakistan. My educational journey has provided me with a solid foundation in a wide range of computer science and engineering disciplines, enabling me to explore and excel in various areas of technology and innovation. With a passion for continuous learning and a drive to make meaningful contributions to the field, I am committed to conducting research that pushes the boundaries of what is possible in the realm of technology.</p>

<p>My academic coursework has equipped me with a strong understanding of core computer science concepts, including programming languages such as C, C++, Cuda, Python, and Java, as well as expertise in web development, web scraping, and DevOps practices. I have also delved into the exciting field of artificial intelligence, gaining experience in machine learning, artificial neural networks, genetic algorithms, natural language processing, computer vision, and data analysis. This background, coupled with my knowledge of cybersecurity and networking, has instilled in me a desire to explore cutting-edge technologies and solve complex problems.</p>

<p>One of my research interests lies in the area of cloud computing, particularly in deploying and managing applications using cloud services such as Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. I have hands-on experience in setting up cloud infrastructure, including EC2 instances, RDS databases, S3 buckets, and using DevOps tools like Git, Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and Terraform. I am eager to explore further how cloud computing can revolutionize the way we develop, deploy, and scale applications.</p>

<p>Moreover, I am deeply interested in natural language processing (NLP) and its applications, especially in the context of healthcare. Currently, I am working on a research project focused on the digitization of prescriptions using NLP techniques, which has the potential to improve patient care and streamline medical record-keeping.</p>

<p>As I progress in my academic journey, I aim to collaborate with experienced researchers and faculty members to further develop my skills, explore new research areas, and contribute to the scientific community. My extensive experience in software development, system administration, and problem-solving, as well as the practical knowledge I have gained through internships and hands-on projects, will be valuable assets as I embark on my research endeavors.</p>

<p>In summary, my academic background, hands-on experience, and passion for innovation make me a dedicated and eager researcher who is poised to tackle the complex challenges in the ever-evolving world of technology. I am excited to take on new research projects and look forward to contributing to the advancement of computer science and technology.</p>

<!-- ## Teaching Statement

Teaching is an art as well as a science. With computer science, this dual nature becomes much more apparent with the theory and practicality of the different fields merging together. A good computer science teacher must have knowledge related to all the subfields of computer science. My experience in the commercial market and detailed knowledge of the low level details of programming and design enable me to convey the essence of contemporary technologies to my students. I believe in conveying a thorough understanding of the theoretical grounds on which a science is built and in enabling the students to understand the rhythm behind the practical applications of these theoretical concepts. The right mix of science and art is a key element in learning and teaching of computer science. Keeping with this view, I maintain a web site2 which offers resources related to computer science and contains my thoughts on how I find, practice and learn new technologies. I encourage my students to use this resource and even contribute to it.

The motivation in a computer science class comes not only from the feeling of seeing one’s work being applied but also from seeing how each part of the learning fits in to the greater whole. I believe in creating a classroom environment in which both these feelings can be mixed together. The aim is always to let the students have an enjoyable semester which conveys the details of the subject and enables them to continue their study after the semester is finished.

Above all, my experience in teaching has shown me that the best way to gain knowledge is to pass it on. I learn through my teaching and convey my knowledge to all those who have helped me gain it. -->
