Well, today i’m uploading the recomendation letter which i recieved just few hours back from my Professor <strong>Dr Hafeez Ur Rehman</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Dr Hafeez Ur Rehman is the Head Of Department of Computer Science in our university (<strong>FAST NUCES PESHAWAR</strong>). I’ve completed my course of Artifical Intelligence with him last semester(<strong>6th</strong>). I’ve defended an <strong>A</strong> in his course. Due to my performance in the course and on my request of recomendation letter to him, he provided me one yesterday.</p>

<p>Alhamdulillah this letter will not only explain my performance but also keep me motivated to learn new skills.</p>

<p>Below is the attached recommendation letter.</p>
