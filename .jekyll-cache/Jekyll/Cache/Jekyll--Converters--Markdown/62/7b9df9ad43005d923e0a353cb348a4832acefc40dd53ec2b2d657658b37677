I"‹<p>Transferring an old blog from wordpress to here. When i was a ‚ÄúFreshie‚Äù in my university. We used to write some blogs on basic topics. One day i was sitting in COLAB(A sort of working environment not the literal LAB) and i was not getting any idea about what to write so i choose the simplest topic haha Computers, Hardwares and Softwares and wrote a hole blog on it. I found it on the other site which i don‚Äôt use so i thought to put it here more like a memory.</p>
