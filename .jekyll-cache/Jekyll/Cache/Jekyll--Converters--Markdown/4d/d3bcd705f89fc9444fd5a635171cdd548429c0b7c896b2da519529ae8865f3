I"•<p>I use the Windows operating system mainly for playing video games. Recently i faced this issue of disk space auto filling up whenever the os got updates resulting in lower remaining space in the os drive. Eventually iâ€™ve to replace the windows with a new one every 2 or 3 years which was a headache.</p>

<p>I did search multiple threads in order to find the solution. Some people said this occur b/c of leftout update files while some were saying the TEMP files as a major cause of this issue. I removed the temp files from the multiple folders <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">prefetch</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Temp</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%temp%</code> (we used to do it in windows 7) but i got 2 or 3 gigs free. Then i found this built in windows feature by the name of Storage Sense. You simply have to turn it on the moment you install the windows and Vola! it will manage/remove all the roleback update files. Here is a snippet where you can find it also there is a path from system settings,</p>
