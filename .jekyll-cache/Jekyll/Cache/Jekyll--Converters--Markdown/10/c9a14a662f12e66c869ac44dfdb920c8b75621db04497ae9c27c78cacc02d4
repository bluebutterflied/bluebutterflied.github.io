I"±<p>I personally use the Windows Key shortcut to open up the start menu and search for the applications from there, usually i pin the most used apps in the start. 
Recently when i was using the menu, i saw this thing of recently opened files displaying there. I mean those files which you used earlier in the past 7 days appear at start and can be disturbing to your workflow.</p>

<p>Gadly iâ€™ve found a solution for it. Simply follow the guide-line. First of all press window button and search for system settings. It will look like this,</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/clt/linux-mint-remove-deleted-files-from-search-menu/1.png" alt="1" /></p>

<p>Then in the preferences section, go to privacy, youâ€™ll see these options,</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/clt/linux-mint-remove-deleted-files-from-search-menu/2.png" alt="2" /></p>

<p>Simply turn off the first option of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">remember recently accessed files</code>,</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/clt/linux-mint-remove-deleted-files-from-search-menu/3.png" alt="3" /></p>

<p>and you are done, your recently opened files will not contradict with the pre-added shortcuts via alphabet typing.</p>
