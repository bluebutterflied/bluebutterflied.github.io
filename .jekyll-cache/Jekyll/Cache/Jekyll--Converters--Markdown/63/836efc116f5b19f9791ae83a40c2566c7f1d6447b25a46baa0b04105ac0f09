I"â<p>Today, iâ€™m going to introduce you to pythonâ€™s Tupple Unpacking, Lambda function and Filter function. We are also going to discuss some Methods in python. These are widely used when working with python. Iâ€™m going to discuss each one by one.</p>

<p>First of all, when it comes to lambda expressions, they are one of the powerful feature in python. They are basically a functions that can be defined in single line, making code more concise and clean. Below is the example of lamba function in python, to double a variable.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>times2 = lambda var: var * 2
result = times2(6)  # This will give you 12

</code></pre></div></div>
