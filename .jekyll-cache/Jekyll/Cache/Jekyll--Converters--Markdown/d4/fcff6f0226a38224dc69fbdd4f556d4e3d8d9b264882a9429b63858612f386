I"T<p>React is one of the readily used framework when it comes to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">web</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mobile</code> developmenmt.</p>

<p>So far, i’ve seen two ways of working in react. The first one is the basic one with 
node pakage execute <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">npx</code> which will give you the all react framework files and the second one
is with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vite</code>. Vite provide you the light files structure by excluding all the un-necessary react 
files at the start.</p>

<p>We’ll focus on react via using the vite. It is much more reliable and easy to download as all
the files are downloaded in few minutes.</p>

<!-- Well, today i'm uploading the recomendation letter which i recieved just few hours back from my Professor `Dr Hafeez Ur Rehman`.

Dr Hafeez Ur Rehman is the Head Of Department of Computer Science in our university (**FAST NUCES PESHAWAR**). I've completed my course of Artifical Intelligence with him last semester(**6th**). I've defended an **A** in his course. Due to my performance in the course and on my request of recomendation letter to him, he provided me one yesterday.

Alhamdulillah this letter will not only explain my performance but also keep me motivated to learn new skills.

Below is the attached recommendation letter.
